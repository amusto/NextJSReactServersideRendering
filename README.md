# nextjs-challenge-boilerplate
A basic boilerplate for nextjs challenge

Hosted on Heroku: http://nextjs-example.musto.io/
Auto deployed when committed to Master branch

You are responsible for writing a node app using nextjs. Your app will consist of two pages (a form, and a feed), and a server that reads and writes to the feed.

Challenge: Create a new Github project with NextJS and React that meets the following criteria:
1. Starts with the command `npm i && npm run dev`
2. Shows a form with “name” and “message” when it runs at localhost:3000
3. When submitting form, runs a `POST` to `/api/guestbook` and resets with a success message (should show an error if things are missing).
4. A link on the homepage takes you to `/guestbook` and shows all posts that have been submitted from the previous form.
  - A link on that page exists to go back to the homepage
  - You do not need to persist that data in any database, just keep it in memory.

**My Notes:**

Logic - When a guest enters their Name and Message, if successful I redirect them to the Guestbook page where they can see their entry.

UI and Styling - 
I looked at how best to import style sheets but ran into a wall.
I'm using style jsx for the most part. I will get the import css style sheets working later for my own education.
Error handling and how I display errors and validation is very simple.

Hosting and deployment - 
I am hosting on heroku where I auto deploy now whenever I commit to the Master repo.

Running local dev (Code Linting) - 
"npm run dev" - 
Code linting is enabled via next.config.js (But it's not running after babel setup. I'll review later.)

Testing with Jest and Enzyme (npm run test)
Runs all tests (With snapshots for react)

TODO:
Add redirect message and logic (from index page where state exists)
Add validation to prevent duplicat guests
Run tests?
Add clear?

##### BONUS

Feel free to add the following
1. Add some UI/UX features
2. Unit tests (coverage)
3. Code linting
I started setting these to warning just so as I was coding it would still build.
